# credit-risk-classification
An overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the accuracy of the machine learning model in predicting the credit risk of borrowers from peer-to-lending services company. 

The results: Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

* Accuracy Score - The accuracy score was about 96.8%.
* Recall Score - For Healthy Loans (0) the Recall Score was 99% and for Unhealthy Loans (1) the Recall Score was 94%
* Precision Score - For Healthy Loans (0) the Precision Score was 100% and for Unhealthy Loans (1) the Precision Score was 84%

A summary: Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you don’t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.

I would recommend the machine learning model since it has a balanced accuracy score of 96.8% in predicting the probability a borrower would be able to repay the loan amount. 

In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
